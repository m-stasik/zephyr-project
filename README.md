# 📌 Project Description – Scouts Panel (DareIT QA Challenge)

This project was completed as part of the **DareIT: QA Challenge – Become a Manual Tester** course and involved testing the **Scouts Panel** web application, available at: [https://scouts-test.futbolkolektyw.pl/pl](https://scouts-test.futbolkolektyw.pl/pl).

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of the project was to gain hands-on experience in manual software testing.

## 🧪 My Role & Responsibilities

- Created test cases for various functionalities of the application  
  (e.g., login, filtering, editing player data, adding matches)  
- Performed both **positive** and **negative** test scenarios  
- Documented test results and reported any issues found  
- Worked with **Zephyr Scale (Jira)** to manage test cases and test cycles  
- Created and maintained **test execution reports** to track test coverage and outcomes  
- Learned to **navigate Zephyr Scale fluently**, organizing test cycles efficiently

## ⚙️ About the Application

**Scouts Panel** is a web platform designed to help football scouts manage player and match data efficiently.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

This project allowed me to:
- Develop skills in **requirements analysis**
- Write structured and clear **test documentation**
- Practice executing test scenarios and **reporting bugs** in a professional QA environment

## 🧠 Reflections & Additional Resources

This project was a valuable learning experience that helped me understand the structure and discipline required in manual testing.  
It taught me how to think critically about user behavior, analyze functionality from a tester's perspective, and maintain clear, structured documentation throughout the testing process.

Through hands-on work with real UI components and test case management in Zephyr Scale, I gained confidence in navigating test environments, creating meaningful test scenarios, and identifying edge cases that could impact user experience.
